title: Writer and Game Designer

I delight in stories, systems, and people. If you're one of those things, you delight me.

I write to explore ideas, perspectives, people, and places: horror, fantasy, science fiction, poetry, and a fair bit of accounting-related humor. [Read my stories](/stories)

I design games that bring us together: to tell stories, build relationships, and enjoy each other -- and sometimes blow stuff up. [Check out my games](/games)
